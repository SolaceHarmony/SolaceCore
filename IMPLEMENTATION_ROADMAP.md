- **Phase 3 can overlap** with others - Documentation is ongoing
- **Phases 4-5 are independent** - Can be reordered based on needs
- **Phase 6 can be deferred** if single-node is sufficient
- **Phase 7 can be done incrementally** as needs arise

## Resource Requirements

For optimal pace:
- **2-3 senior engineers** for core development
- **1 DevOps engineer** for infrastructure (Phase 2)
- **1 technical writer** for documentation (Phase 3)
- **1 security engineer** for security (Phase 5, consulting basis)

With 1 engineer, multiply timelines by 2-3x.
