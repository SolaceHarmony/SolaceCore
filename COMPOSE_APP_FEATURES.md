# SolaceCore Compose App Features Documentation

## Overview

The SolaceCore Compose application has been enhanced with comprehensive features that align with the actor and channel architecture of the SolaceCore framework. This document outlines the new features and improvements made to the multiplatform Compose application.

## Architecture

The application is built as a Kotlin Multiplatform project supporting both desktop and web platforms using Jetpack Compose. It provides real-time monitoring and management capabilities for the SolaceCore actor system.

## New Features Added

### 1. Channel Monitoring System

**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/solace/composeapp/ui/components/ChannelMonitoringView.kt`

- **Real-time Channel Visualization**: Displays active channels with connection states, metrics, and throughput information
- **Connection State Indicators**: Visual badges showing Connected, Disconnected, Connecting, or Error states
- **Channel Metrics**: Message counts (sent/received/dropped), latency, throughput, and error rates
- **Source-Target Mapping**: Clear display of data flow between actors

### 2. Workflow Visualization

**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/solace/composeapp/ui/components/WorkflowVisualizationView.kt`

- **Visual Workflow Diagrams**: Graphical representation of actor connections and data flow
- **Actor Node Positioning**: Automatic grid-based layout for actor visualization
- **Workflow State Management**: Display of workflow status (Running, Stopped, Paused, Error, Initialized)
- **Interactive Elements**: Visual feedback for workflow states and connections

### 3. Enhanced Actor Management

**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/solace/composeapp/ui/components/ActorControlPanel.kt`

- **Lifecycle Controls**: Start, Stop, Pause, Resume functionality for individual actors
- **Bulk Operations**: Quick action buttons for managing all actors simultaneously
- **Actor Creation/Deletion**: Interface for dynamic actor management
- **State-Aware Controls**: Context-sensitive buttons based on current actor state

### 4. Improved Actor List

**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/solace/composeapp/ui/components/ActorListView.kt`

- **Clickable Selection**: Interactive actor selection with visual feedback
- **Enhanced Metrics Display**: Comprehensive display of actor performance metrics
- **State Indicators**: Color-coded badges for different actor states
- **Responsive Design**: Improved layout and spacing for better usability

### 5. Extended Data Models

**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/solace/composeapp/ui/data/ChannelDisplayData.kt`

- **Channel Data Structures**: Complete data models for channel monitoring
- **Workflow Representations**: Data structures for workflow visualization
- **Metrics Tracking**: Enhanced metrics for channels and workflows
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state definitions for all components

### 6. Enhanced Real-Time Service

**File**: `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/solace/composeapp/ui/service/RealTimeActorService.kt`

- **Multi-Component Monitoring**: Simultaneous tracking of actors, channels, and workflows
- **Lifecycle Management**: Methods for actor creation, deletion, and state control
- **Realistic Sample Data**: Enhanced mock data for demonstration purposes
- **Extended Update Cycles**: Comprehensive real-time updates across all components

## Technical Improvements

### Multiplatform Compatibility Fixes

1. **String Formatting**: Replaced `String.format()` calls with multiplatform-compatible formatting
2. **Time APIs**: Migrated from `System.currentTimeMillis()` to `Clock.System.now().toEpochMilliseconds()`
3. **Icon Compatibility**: Simplified icon usage to avoid multiplatform compilation issues

### UI/UX Enhancements

1. **Two-Column Layout**: Organized interface into monitoring and control sections
2. **Visual Feedback**: Added selection states and interactive elements
3. **Consistent Design**: Unified color scheme and typography across components
4. **Responsive Components**: Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## Data Flow

1. **RealTimeActorService** provides reactive data streams for:
   - Actor states and metrics
   - Channel connection states and throughput
   - Workflow states and structure
   - System-wide metrics

2. **UI Components** consume these streams and provide:
   - Real-time visualization updates
   - Interactive controls for lifecycle management
   - User feedback and status indicators

## Future Integration Points

The current implementation uses mock data for demonstration. Future integration with the actual SolaceCore framework would involve:

1. **Actor System Integration**: Connect to real ActorSupervisor for live data
2. **Channel Monitoring**: Interface with actual Port and Channel implementations
3. **Workflow Management**: Integration with WorkflowManager for real workflow control
4. **Persistence**: Connect to storage systems for state persistence

## Build and Deployment

The application successfully builds for both desktop and web platforms:

- **Desktop**: `./gradlew :composeApp:desktopRun`
- **Web**: `./gradlew :composeApp:webBrowserDevelopmentRun`

All multiplatform compatibility issues have been resolved, and the application compiles cleanly for both target platforms.

## Conclusion

The enhanced SolaceCore Compose application now provides a comprehensive, real-time monitoring and management interface that aligns closely with the actor and channel architecture of the SolaceCore framework. The implementation demonstrates advanced Compose UI patterns, multiplatform development practices, and provides a solid foundation for future integration with the actual SolaceCore runtime system.
