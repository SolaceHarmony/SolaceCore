# Task 5: Add Integration Tests [HIGH PRIORITY]

Expand test coverage beyond unit tests to include comprehensive integration and end-to-end testing.

## Objectives
- ✅ Add integration tests for port-to-port communication
- ✅ Add property-based tests for type conversion system  
- ✅ Implement end-to-end workflow tests
- ✅ Add performance tests for actor communication

## Current Status
Tests needed for:
- Message flow validation between connected actors
- Type conversion accuracy across different data types
- Complete workflow execution from start to finish
- Performance benchmarks for throughput and latency
- Concurrent access patterns and thread safety
- Resource cleanup and memory leak detection

## Success Criteria
- All integration tests pass consistently
- Performance benchmarks establish baseline metrics
- Test coverage includes edge cases and error conditions
- Tests validate both functional and non-functional requirements
