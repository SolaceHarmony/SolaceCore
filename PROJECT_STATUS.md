## Conclusion

SolaceCore has a **solid, production-ready core** (85-90% complete) with excellent test coverage and well-designed architecture. The framework is ready for:
- ✅ Building single-node actor-based applications
- ✅ Hot-pluggable component systems
- ✅ Complex workflows with type-safe messaging
- ✅ State persistence with multiple storage backends

However, to achieve the **full vision** outlined in the design documents, significant work remains in:
- ❌ Distributed operation and clustering
- ❌ Production monitoring and observability
- ❌ Cloud-native deployment
- ❌ Developer tooling and experience
- ❌ Security and access control

**Recommendation:** Focus on Phase 1 (stability and monitoring) before expanding into distributed capabilities. The current single-node implementation is robust and can serve many use cases effectively.
