# Task 6: Complete Deadlock Detection [HIGH PRIORITY]

Implement comprehensive deadlock detection and prevention mechanisms for the actor system.

## Objectives
- ✅ Add deadlock detection mechanisms for actor systems
- ✅ Implement monitoring for thread pool saturation
- ✅ Add timeout detection for hanging operations
- ✅ Create automated recovery strategies

## Current Status
Areas requiring deadlock detection:
- Actor message passing queues
- Port connection establishment
- Storage system transactions
- Workflow state transitions
- Supervisor actor operations

## Technical Approach
- Implement timeout-based detection for blocking operations
- Add thread pool monitoring and alerts
- Create dependency graph analysis for circular waits
- Implement automatic recovery and circuit breaker patterns
- Add comprehensive logging for deadlock diagnosis

## Success Criteria
- System can detect potential deadlocks before they occur
- Automatic recovery mechanisms restore system functionality
- Performance impact of detection is minimal
- Clear diagnostics help troubleshoot deadlock conditions
