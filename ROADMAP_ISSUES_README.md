# Creating GitHub Issues from Implementation Roadmap

This document explains how to create GitHub issues from the checklist items in `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`.

## Overview

The implementation roadmap contains **208 checklist items** across **8 phases**. Rather than creating 208 individual issues (which would be overwhelming), these have been grouped into **27 meaningful issues** organized by phase and section.

## What's Included

### Phase 1: Stability & Testing (4 issues)
1. **Integration Tests** (2 weeks) - 6 tasks - ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL
2. **Deadlock Detection** (2-3 weeks) - 6 tasks - ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL  
3. **Performance Benchmarks** (1 week) - 5 tasks
4. **Enhanced Error Handling** (2 weeks) - 5 tasks

### Phase 2: Production Infrastructure (6 issues)
1. **Prometheus Metrics** (1-2 weeks) - 6 tasks - ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY
2. **Health Checks** (1 week) - 5 tasks
3. **Kubernetes Deployment** (1-2 weeks) - 8 tasks
4. **Production Docker Images** (1 week) - 6 tasks
5. **Grafana Dashboards** (1 week) - 5 tasks
6. **Distributed Tracing** (1-2 weeks) - 4 tasks (Optional)

### Phase 3: Documentation & Developer Experience (5 issues)
1. **Complete API Documentation** (2 weeks) - 5 tasks
2. **Getting Started Guide** (1 week) - 6 tasks
3. **Best Practices Guide** (1 week) - 6 tasks
4. **Migration Guide** (1 week) - 4 tasks
5. **Enhanced CLI Tool** (2-3 weeks) - 6 tasks

### Phase 4: Graph Database Integration (1 issue)
1. **Neo4j Integration** (3-4 weeks) - 8 tasks

### Phase 5: Security Framework (5 issues)
1. **Authentication System** (2 weeks) - 5 tasks
2. **Authorization Framework** (2 weeks) - 5 tasks
3. **Message Encryption** (1 week) - 4 tasks
4. **Audit Logging** (1 week) - 5 tasks
5. **Security Hardening** (1-2 weeks) - 6 tasks

### Phase 6: Distributed System (6 issues)
1. **Network Transport Layer** (2-3 weeks) - 6 tasks
2. **Service Discovery** (1-2 weeks) - 5 tasks
3. **Distributed Actor Communication** (3-4 weeks) - 6 tasks
4. **State Replication** (2-3 weeks) - 5 tasks
5. **Clustering Support** (3-4 weeks) - 6 tasks
6. **Load Balancing** (1-2 weeks) - 5 tasks

**Note:** Phase 7 (Advanced Features) and Phase 8 (Ecosystem) have been excluded as they are longer-term future enhancements.

## Files Generated

1. **`roadmap_issues.json`** - JSON file containing all 27 issues with titles, bodies, and labels
2. **`scripts/create_roadmap_issues.sh`** - Bash script to create issues via GitHub CLI

## How to Create the Issues

### Option 1: Using the Bash Script (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`

**Steps:**
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/SolaceCore/SolaceCore
./scripts/create_roadmap_issues.sh
```

The script will:
- Read `roadmap_issues.json`
- Create each issue in the SolaceHarmony/SolaceCore repository
- Apply appropriate labels and formatting
- Show progress and summary

### Option 2: Manual Creation via GitHub UI

If you prefer to create issues manually or want to customize them:

1. Open `roadmap_issues.json`
2. For each issue object:
   - Copy the `title` field
   - Copy the `body` field
   - Note the `labels` array
3. Go to: https://github.com/SolaceHarmony/SolaceCore/issues/new
4. Paste title and body
5. Add labels manually

### Option 3: Using GitHub API

Use the GitHub REST API with the JSON file:

```bash
# Example using curl
for issue in $(jq -c '.[]' roadmap_issues.json); do
  title=$(echo $issue | jq -r '.title')
  body=$(echo $issue | jq -r '.body')
  labels=$(echo $issue | jq -r '.labels | join(",")')
  
  gh api repos/SolaceHarmony/SolaceCore/issues \
    -f title="$title" \
    -f body="$body" \
    -f labels="$labels"
done
```

## Issue Labels Applied

Each issue will have these labels:

**Base Labels:**
- `enhancement` - All issues are enhancements
- `roadmap` - Identifies issues from the roadmap

**Priority Labels:**
- `priority: critical` - Must be done first (2 issues)
- `priority: high` - Important for production (1 issue)
- No priority label - Medium priority (24 issues)

**Phase Labels:**
- `phase: stability` - Phase 1 issues (4 issues)
- `phase: infrastructure` - Phase 2 issues (6 issues)
- `phase: documentation` - Phase 3 issues (5 issues)
- `phase: graph-db` - Phase 4 issues (1 issue)
- `phase: security` - Phase 5 issues (5 issues)
- `phase: distributed` - Phase 6 issues (6 issues)

## Issue Format

Each issue includes:

**Header:**
- Phase name and description
- Estimated effort (in weeks)
- Why this task is important
- Code location where work should be done

**Tasks Section:**
- Checklist of all tasks (from `- [ ]` items in roadmap)
- Can be checked off as work progresses

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear definition of when the issue is complete
- Measurable outcomes

**Footer:**
- Link back to IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md

## After Creating Issues

1. **Milestone Assignment:** Consider creating milestones for each phase and assigning issues
2. **Project Board:** Add issues to a project board for tracking progress
3. **Assignment:** Assign issues to team members based on expertise and availability
4. **Prioritization:** Start with Phase 1 (Stability) issues marked as CRITICAL
5. **Dependencies:** Some issues may depend on others being completed first

## Recommended Creation Strategy

**Immediate (Now):**
- Create all Phase 1 issues (Stability & Testing)
- Create Phase 2 issues (Production Infrastructure)

**Short-term (1-2 months):**
- Create Phase 3 issues (Documentation)
- Create Phase 4 issues (Neo4j Integration)

**Medium-term (3-4 months):**
- Create Phase 5 issues (Security)

**Long-term (6+ months):**
- Create Phase 6 issues (Distributed System)

This staged approach prevents overwhelming the issue tracker while maintaining visibility into upcoming work.

## Customization

To modify the issues before creation:

1. Edit `roadmap_issues.json` directly
2. Adjust titles, bodies, or labels as needed
3. Run the creation script

Or regenerate from source:

```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
# The Python script from earlier can be modified and re-run
# to regenerate roadmap_issues.json with different filtering or formatting
EOF
```

## Statistics

- **Total Issues:** 27 (from 208 individual tasks)
- **Estimated Total Effort:** 55-80 weeks (14-20 months)
- **Critical Priority:** 2 issues
- **High Priority:** 1 issue  
- **Medium Priority:** 24 issues
- **Average Tasks per Issue:** 7.7 tasks
- **Phases Covered:** 6 of 8 (Phase 7 & 8 excluded as long-term)

## Questions?

- **Why grouped?** 208 individual issues would be overwhelming. Grouping by section makes them manageable.
- **Why exclude Phase 7 & 8?** These are advanced features and ecosystem development - long-term goals that don't need immediate tracking.
- **Can I split issues?** Yes! If an issue is too large, you can close it and create sub-issues.
- **Should I create all at once?** Recommended to start with Phase 1 & 2, then add others as you progress.
