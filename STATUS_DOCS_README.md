## 🎯 Key Findings

### What's Working (85-90% Complete)
```
✅ Actor System - Full lifecycle, hot-swapping, metrics
✅ Port System - Type-safe messaging, conversion rules
✅ Storage System - File, memory, transactions, caching, encryption
✅ Scripting Engine - Kotlin script compilation and execution
✅ Workflow Management - Basic orchestration and routing
✅ Test Coverage - 360+ comprehensive tests
✅ Compose UI - Real-time monitoring and visualization
```

### Critical Gaps (0-15% Complete)
```
❌ Distributed/Clustered Operation
❌ Kubernetes Deployment Configs
❌ Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring
❌ Neo4j Graph Database
