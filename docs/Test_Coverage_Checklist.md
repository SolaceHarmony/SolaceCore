# Test Coverage Checklist

This document provides an overview of the current test coverage in the SolaceCore project, listing classes and functions that are covered by tests versus those that are not.

## Summary

Based on the analysis of the codebase, here's a summary of test coverage by package:

| Package   | Coverage Status | Notes                                                      |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| actor     | Partial         | Basic Actor tests exist, but many components lack coverage |
| kernel    | Good            | Port, BidirectionalPort, and MessageHandlers have tests    |
| lifecycle | Good            | Lifecycle and Disposable have tests                        |
| scripting | Good            | Most scripting components have tests                       |
| storage   | Good            | Most storage components have tests                         |
| workflow  | Minimal         | Only basic workflow tests exist                            |
|  util     | Good            | LoggerProvider has tests                                   |

## Recommendations

Based on the current test coverage analysis, here are some recommendations for improving test coverage:

1. **Priority Areas for New Tests:**
   - Storage package interfaces and remaining components
   - Actor package (more comprehensive tests)
   - Workflow package (more comprehensive tests)

2. **Enhance Existing Tests:**
   - Expand Actor tests to cover more scenarios
   - Add more comprehensive tests for WorkflowManager

3. **Test Infrastructure:**
   - Consider implementing a test coverage tool like JaCoCo to automatically track coverage metrics
   - Set up continuous integration to run tests and report coverage

4. **Test Types to Add:**
   - Integration tests for interactions between components
   - Performance tests for critical paths
   - Concurrency tests for thread-safe components

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Implement tests for the kernel package components (BidirectionalPort, Port, PortException)
2. ✓ Add tests for lifecycle components (Disposable, Lifecycle)
3. ✓ Implement tests for MessageHandlers in the kernel package
4. ✓ Implement tests for ActorMessage in the actor package
5. ✓ Implement tests for ActorState in the actor package
6. ✓ Implement tests for ActorBuilder in the actor package
7. ✓ Expand actor tests to cover Filter, TextProcessor, and ActorMetrics
8. ✓ Add tests for CompiledScript and ScriptActor in the scripting package
9. ✓ Continue with remaining components:
   - Add tests for the remaining untested components in the storage package
   - Add more comprehensive tests for WorkflowManager
   - ✓ Add tests for LoggerProvider in the util package
10. Set up a test coverage tool like JaCoCo to automatically track coverage metrics
