## üìù Notes

- Priority should be given to core actor system stability
- Focus on developer experience and documentation
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow Kotlin best practices
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery
- Keep security in mind throughout development
- The storage system is a critical component of the SolaceCore framework and should be designed for reliability, performance, and scalability.
- The in-memory implementations are useful for development and testing, but production systems should use persistent storage implementations.
- Deadlocks can occur when multiple threads attempt to acquire locks in different orders. Follow the best practices in the DEADLOCK_PREVENTION.md document to avoid deadlocks.
- The storage system should be designed to be extensible, allowing for different storage backends to be used as needed.
- The storage system should be designed to be thread-safe, allowing for concurrent access from multiple threads.
