## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The Solace Core Framework consists of several key components organized in a layered architecture:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                   Applications                     |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                     Workflows                      |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                    Actor System                    |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                      Kernel                        |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                    Data Storage                    |
+---------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Kernel**: The foundational layer providing communication primitives, resource management, and lifecycle control
- **Actor System**: The core runtime environment for actor creation, management, and message passing
- **Workflows**: Higher-level orchestration of actors into processing pipelines
- **Applications**: Domain-specific implementations built on the framework
- **Data Storage**: Persistence layer using graph and relational databases

### 2.2 Component Overview

The framework comprises the following major components:

1. **Actor System**: Manages the creation, lifecycle, and communication of actors
2. **Port System**: Enables type-safe message passing between actors
3. **Supervisor**: Oversees actor lifecycles and manages system resources
4. **Workflow Manager**: Orchestrates the execution of actors in defined workflows
5. **Storage System**: Provides persistence capabilities for actor state and system data

## 3. Actor System

### 3.1 Actor Model Implementation

The actor model forms the backbone of the Solace Core Framework, providing a concurrency model based on message passing rather than shared state. Each actor is an independent unit of computation with the following characteristics:

- **Encapsulated State**: Actors maintain their own state, which is not directly accessible by other actors
- **Message-Driven**: Actors communicate exclusively through asynchronous message passing
- **Reactive Processing**: Actors respond to incoming messages, process them, and potentially send messages to other actors
- **Lifecycle Management**: Actors follow a defined lifecycle (initialization, running, paused, stopped, error)

### 3.2 Actor Structure

The base `Actor` class implements the following interfaces and components:

- **Lifecycle Interface**: Defines methods for starting, stopping, and checking the active state of an actor
- **Disposable Interface**: Ensures proper resource cleanup when an actor is no longer needed
- **Coroutine Scope**: Each actor operates within its own coroutine scope for asynchronous processing
- **Ports**: Actors expose typed ports for input and output communication
- **Metrics Collection**: Built-in mechanisms for gathering performance metrics

### 3.3 Actor Lifecycle

Actors in the framework follow a well-defined lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: Actor is created and resources are allocated
2. **Starting**: Actor begins processing messages and transitions to the Running state
3. **Running**: Actor actively processes messages
4. **Paused**: Actor temporarily suspends processing but maintains state
5. **Stopped**: Actor ceases processing and prepares for disposal
6. **Error**: Actor enters an error state when exceptions occur
7. **Disposal**: Actor releases all resources and terminates

### 3.4 Actor Communication

Actors communicate through a port system that provides type-safe message passing:

- **Typed Ports**: Each port is associated with a specific message type
- **Channels**: Kotlin coroutine channels provide the underlying message passing mechanism
- **Message Handlers**: Custom processing logic can be applied to messages during transmission
- **Conversion Rules**: Enable type transformations between compatible message types

## 4. Port System

### 4.1 Port Design

The port system enables type-safe communication between actors through a well-defined interface:

- **Port Interface**: Defines methods for sending messages and accessing the underlying channel
- **BidirectionalPort Implementation**: Concrete implementation supporting bidirectional communication
- **TypedPort Wrapper**: Associates a port with a specific message type and processing handler

### 4.2 Port Connections

Ports are connected to establish communication pathways between actors:

- **Type Compatibility**: Connections are only allowed between ports with compatible message types
- **Validation**: The system validates port connections to ensure type safety
- **Multiple Connections**: Ports can be connected to multiple other ports

### 4.3 Message Processing

Messages flowing through ports undergo several processing stages:

1. **Sending**: Actor sends a message through an output port
2. **Handler Application**: Message handlers process the message
3. **Conversion**: Type conversion rules transform the message if needed
4. **Channel Transmission**: Message is sent through the underlying channel
5. **Reception**: Receiving actor's input port receives the message
6. **Processing**: Message is processed by the receiving actor

## 5. Hot-Pluggable System

### 5.1 Dynamic Actor Management

The framework supports hot-pluggable actors through several mechanisms:

- **Dynamic Registration**: Actors can register and unregister with the supervisor at runtime
- **Interface Discovery**: The system can discover actor interfaces to determine compatibility
- **Connection Management**: Dynamic creation and modification of connections between actors

### 5.2 Supervisor Role

The supervisor actor plays a critical role in enabling hot-pluggable capabilities:

- **Actor Registry**: Maintains a registry of available actors and their interfaces
- **Lifecycle Management**: Controls actor lifecycles, including creation, starting, stopping, and disposal
- **Resource Allocation**: Manages system resources to ensure efficient operation
- **Error Handling**: Monitors actors for errors and takes appropriate recovery actions

### 5.3 Implementation Challenges

Implementing a hot-pluggable actor system presents several challenges:

- **State Transfer**: Transferring state from an old actor to a new version during hot-swapping
- **Message Continuity**: Ensuring no messages are lost during actor replacement
- **Reference Management**: Updating references to actors across the system
- **Version Compatibility**: Managing compatibility between different versions of actors

## 6. Workflow Management

### 6.1 Workflow Design

Workflows provide a higher-level abstraction for composing actors into processing pipelines:

- **Actor Composition**: Connecting actors to form directed processing graphs
- **Data Flow**: Defining the flow of data between actors in a workflow
- **State Management**: Tracking and managing workflow state throughout execution

### 6.2 Workflow Manager

The Workflow Manager orchestrates the execution of workflows:

- **Workflow Creation**: Building workflows by connecting compatible actors
- **Execution Control**: Starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming workflows
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors that occur during workflow execution
- **Monitoring**: Tracking workflow progress and performance

### 6.3 Current Implementation Status

The workflow management system is partially implemented:

- **Completed**: Basic workflow management and actor composition
- **In Progress**: Advanced state management and error handling
- **Planned**: Workflow pause/resume functionality and state persistence

## 7. Data Storage and Management

### 7.1 Storage Architecture

The framework uses a hybrid storage approach:

- **Graph Database (Neo4j)**: For storing relationships between actors, knowledge nodes, and data flow
- **Kotlin-Native Storage**: For structured data needs, supporting tabular or relational-style data

### 7.2 Persistence Mechanisms

Actor state persistence is a key capability:

- **State Serialization**: Converting actor state to a serializable format
- **Storage Integration**: Saving and loading state from the storage system
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Restoring actor state after system restarts or failures

### 7.3 Implementation Plan

Storage integration is currently in the planning phase:

- **Neo4j Integration**: Planned for representing actor relationships and knowledge graphs
- **Kotlin-Native Storage**: Planned for structured data and actor state persistence
- **Data Synchronization**: Mechanisms for keeping data consistent across the system

## 8. Concurrency and Communication

### 8.1 Coroutine Usage

Kotlin coroutines provide the foundation for asynchronous processing:

- **Actor Scopes**: Each actor operates within its own coroutine scope
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking message handling using suspend functions
- **Structured Concurrency**: Managing the lifecycle of concurrent operations

### 8.2 Channel-Based Communication

Coroutine channels enable type-safe message passing between actors:

- **Channel Types**: Different channel types (buffered, conflated, etc.) for various use cases
- **Flow Control**: Handling backpressure and preventing overflow
- **Message Ordering**: Preserving message order when required

### 8.3 Concurrency Control

The framework includes mechanisms for controlling concurrency:

- **Mutex**: For thread-safe access to shared resources
