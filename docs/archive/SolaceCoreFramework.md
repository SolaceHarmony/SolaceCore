**Title: Solace Core Framework: Vision and Design Overview**

**Introduction**  
The Solace Core Framework is a unique endeavor aiming to build a versatile, resilient, and extendable platform using Kotlin and Ktor. The project's primary goals are to create a flexible, actor-based system that supports dynamic, hot-pluggable components, similar to LangFlow or LangChain's modular input/output nodes. This document provides an overview of the design, intended capabilities, and a detailed breakdown of the architectural decisions.

### **Key Objectives**
1. **Hot-Pluggable Actor System**: Build an actor-based architecture using Ktor that allows dynamic addition and modification of components without restarting the whole system.
2. **Agent Scripts for Versatility**: Utilize embedded Kotlin interpreters to create actors with specialized capabilities. These interpreters will support on-the-fly scripting, fostering agent-like behavior.
3. **Clusterable Architecture**: Ensure the architecture supports clustering with multiple nodes capable of self-replication and syncing. Focus on Docker-based containerization with Kubernetes (K8) as an optional scaling environment.
4. **Flexible Inputs/Outputs like LangFlow**: Mimic LangFlow's capability to create distinct input/output types for each actor, ensuring actors can dynamically determine their compatibility and integration.
5. **Storage via Graph + Local DB**: Implement an innovative data storage solution using Neo4j for relationships and graph data, alongside a Kotlin-native storage for structured, table-like data.

### **Architecture Overview**
1. **Supervisory Ktor Instance**
    - The supervisor instance is a core architectural element that manages and controls the other nodes.
    - Runs within a Docker container, responsible for monitoring the health and functionality of worker instances.
    - Interacts with a separate Docker instance that manages the development and deployment of actors.

2. **Worker Ktor Instances**
    - Runs on Linux-based containers, managed and orchestrated by the supervisor.
    - Contains all actors used for various purposes, isolated from the supervisor.
    - Promotes a safe, sandboxed environment where experimentation with new actor components does not affect the stability of the system.

3. **Actor Design and Behavior**
    - **Actor Concept**: Actors in Solace Core are treated as independent modules that are responsible for specific tasks (e.g., processing data, managing queues, or interacting with other actors).
    - **Kotlin Embedding**: Kotlin scripts will be embedded to allow flexible behavior changes within actors. This is akin to having "pluggable brains" where actor logic can be modified dynamically.
    - **Messaging and Queueing**: Each actor instance communicates via queues, ensuring robust flow management. This mechanism prevents memory leaks by queueing all input requests and providing an organized execution path.
    - **Persistence**: Actor states will be serialized and stored in a Kotlin-native database. In case of downtime, actor scripts will be reloaded and reinstated to ensure continuity.

4. **Interpreters and Scripts**
    - Use Kotlin interpreters to enable hot-plugging and scripting for actors. These interpreters are essential for allowing actors to adapt and extend without needing a complete redeployment.
    - Embedded scripts can return values and also communicate via channels, making the input/output functionality flexible and expandable.

5. **Clustering and Synchronization**
    - The worker nodes should run in a clustered environment where they self-synchronize using actor-based database systems.
    - A distributed channel approach ensures that updates to one actor are propagated across nodes, maintaining a consistent state.
    - Potential implementations include utilizing SQLite alongside a clustering layer or exploring more sophisticated distributed databases.

### **Data Storage and Management**
1. **Graph Storage with Neo4j**
    - Neo4j will serve as the graph-based database for representing the relationships between different actors, knowledge nodes, topics, and data flow.
    - It will support advanced scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the supervisor can intelligently retrieve related knowledge.

2. **Kotlin Native Storage**
    - A Kotlin-native storage solution will be employed for structured data needs, supporting tabular or relational-style data.
    - This is essential to ensure the actors can store intermediate results, states, and other data persistently without heavy reliance on external non-Kotlin-native systems.

### **High-Level Use Case**
- **Developer Sandbox**: The supervisor Ktor instance manages multiple Docker instances that house worker actors. The worker actors run scripts for specific functions (e.g., tax calculations, form processing, or integration with third-party APIs). The developer can write new scripts, update actors, or experiment in a sandbox environment without affecting production stability.
- **Knowledge Graph & Retrieval**: The knowledge graph enables actors to dynamically understand the relationships between data and tasks, optimizing responses. The graph can also point actors to potential code examples or agents for specific jobs.

### **Implementation Roadmap**
1. **MVP Development**
    - Implement supervisor-worker instance setup using Docker with basic clustering.
    - Build core actor types: supervisory, processing, queue management.
    - Develop initial version of the Kotlin embedded interpreter for dynamic actor scripting.
2. **Integration with Graph DB**
    - Connect Neo4j to represent actor interrelationships.
    - Implement RAG-like capabilities using graph data to retrieve relevant scripts and behaviors.
3. **Advanced Actor Features**
    - Add queuing mechanisms to actors for efficient task management and preventing uncontrolled memory growth.
    - Enable callback inputs for scenarios requiring long hibernation or deferred processing.
4. **Hot-Pluggable System Exploration**
    - Investigate dynamic class loading/unloading via JVM or other experimental solutions.
    - Extend Ktor as needed to make actors and components reloadable.

**2. Actors in Solace Core - Design and Implementation**

### Overview
The actor model is foundational in Solace Core, functioning as the modular units that encapsulate distinct tasks and can be composed, replicated, and replaced in runtime to build complex AI-driven workflows. The use of actors provides several advantages, including **scalability**, **hot-swapping** capabilities, and **resilience**. Below, we outline the specifics of the actor design and their application in Solace Core.

### Actor Characteristics

1. **Self-Contained Modules**: Each actor is designed to perform a specific function, whether it's a computational task, data transformation, or orchestration role. Actors contain all the code, dependencies, and configurations necessary for their operation, encapsulated within Docker containers for easy portability.

2. **Interfaces for Inputs and Outputs**: Inspired by **LangFlow** and **LangChain**, each actor has clearly defined **input and output types**, ensuring that actors can be linked logically based on compatible inputs and outputs. This model ensures type safety while promoting flexibility and reusability of actors in multiple workflows.

3. **Communication Channels**:
    - Actors communicate with each other using **Ktor channels** and queues. This messaging-based interaction provides resilience, as actors can be substituted or scaled without impacting the communication layer.
    - **Message Queues** are employed to prevent flooding and control resource allocation for each actor, ensuring each instance can handle tasks without overloading system memory or CPU.

4. **Queuing and Correlation IDs**:
    - Actors support long-running processes via **hibernate-and-resume** functionality. Tasks are tagged with a **Correlation ID** that allows actors to pause and later resume processing. This feature is crucial for workflows involving external callbacks or time-sensitive waiting periods.

5. **Embedded Kotlin Interpreter**:
    - By integrating a Kotlin-based scripting interpreter, actors can adapt their functionality without requiring recompilation or redeployment. This interpreter allows for on-the-fly customization and transformation, which is crucial for adjusting behavior dynamically in response to real-time events.

### Actor Types
1. **Core Actors**: These are the fundamental building blocks, responsible for tasks like **data ingestion**, **transformation**, and **enrichment**. Examples include:
    - **Data Transformer Actors**: Transform incoming data based on predefined or dynamically supplied schemas.
    - **Enrichment Actors**: Pull additional information from databases (e.g., SQLite or Neo4j) to enrich incoming datasets.

2. **Utility Actors**: Provide supportive capabilities to the system, such as **logging**, **monitoring**, and **observability**.
    - **Logging Actor**: Monitors incoming messages and provides system logging through centralized aggregation.
    - **Metrics Actor**: Collects and reports metrics using Prometheus.

3. **Supervisor Actors**:
    - **Supervisors** manage actor lifecycle events like creation, destruction, scaling, and logging. They ensure that worker actors operate within defined parameters and that system stability is maintained.
    - Supervisor actors also manage **actor registry**, holding metadata about available actors and their respective input-output capabilities, allowing dynamic workflow construction.

### Designing Hot-Pluggable Actors
1. **Dynamic Actor Management**:
    - Actors are designed to be hot-pluggable, enabling the addition, modification, or removal of actors without requiring a full system restart. This is achieved through supervisor actors, which dynamically manage actors at runtime.
    - Actors register themselves to the supervisor when initialized, providing metadata such as supported input-output types, version, and availability.

2. **Input and Output Flexibility**:
    - Inspired by **LangFlow**, actors define their input and output capabilities through either **interfaces** or metadata configurations.
    - This metadata is then utilized by the supervisor actor to determine how to construct workflows and link actors dynamically.
    - The system’s flexibility allows for the reuse of core functionality across various workflows, reducing redundancy and improving scalability.

### Sample Actor Implementation
- **Data Transformer Example**:
  ```kotlin
  package ai.solace.core.actors

  import kotlinx.coroutines.channels.Channel

  class DataTransformerActor : Actor() {
      private val inputChannel = Channel<Data>()
      private val outputChannel = Channel<TransformedData>()

      override suspend fun process() {
          for (data in inputChannel) {
              val transformedData = transform(data)
              outputChannel.send(transformedData)
          }
      }

      private fun transform(data: Data): TransformedData {
          // Transformation logic goes here
          return TransformedData(data.content.toUpperCase())
      }
  }
  ```
    - The above actor reads data from its input channel, transforms it (e.g., converting content to uppercase), and sends the result to the output channel. This modularity allows for straightforward replacement or extension.

### Orchestration Layer
- **Supervisor as Orchestrator**: The supervisor acts as the orchestrator, linking multiple actors based on a defined workflow or dynamically determining actor flow based on the input/output compatibility.
- **Neo4j and Relationships**: Neo4j stores relationships between different actors, input-output metadata, and workflows, allowing the system to make decisions based on the current knowledge graph to build new flows, expand capabilities, or suggest optimizations.

### Challenges & Future Work
1. **State Management**: Managing state between hibernation and reactivation of long-running processes remains a challenge and is being refined to ensure seamless transitions.
2. **Actor Discovery and Plugging**: Automatic actor discovery mechanisms need to be optimized for reliability, especially when introducing new or external actors.
3. **Scalability**: Current designs are being improved to leverage Kubernetes for orchestration, enabling better scaling across cloud environments.

### Summary
Actors in Solace Core provide modularity, scalability, and resilience. They serve as fundamental building blocks capable of independent deployment, flexible hot-plugging, and seamless integration, ensuring that Solace Core can dynamically adapt to evolving requirements and complexities. This design also allows the system to incorporate new capabilities and optimizations without downtime, establishing a powerful framework for building distributed AI systems.

**3. Queue and Hibernation Design in Solace Core**

### Overview
In Solace Core, managing workflows involving long wait times or external processes that may require an actor to "hibernate" (pause its activity) is a core component of the architecture. This design aims to efficiently use resources, avoiding overloading memory or CPU while still maintaining system responsiveness and ensuring tasks are properly completed. Below, we detail how queuing, hibernation, correlation management, and task lifecycle tracking work in this system.

### Task Queuing & Correlation Management

1. **Centralized Queue Management**:
    - A centralized **task queue** is implemented, inspired by systems like **BizTalk** and message brokers such as **RabbitMQ**. This task queue manages the entire lifecycle of messages, from initiation to completion.
    - The **Queue Manager** is implemented as a series of **Kotlin Coroutines** that control message flow between actors. Each task, upon creation, is added to a shared queue with an associated **Correlation ID**.

2. **Correlation ID for State Management**:
    - Each task that passes through the queue is tagged with a **Correlation ID**. This ID uniquely identifies each task and helps actors understand where in the workflow they are.
    - The Correlation ID is essential for **long-lived processes** that hibernate and need to be resumed later without re-running previous stages.

3. **Actor-Level Queues**:
    - Each actor has its own queue to ensure that messages are managed at a local level. The local queues prevent actors from being overwhelmed, as tasks are controlled and regulated through the centralized queue manager.
    - This **two-tiered queuing system** (central and local) ensures both system-wide scalability and actor-level performance optimization.

### Hibernation and Resuming Actors
1. **Task Hibernation**:
    - Certain tasks involve waiting for external events or responses (e.g., waiting for an external API to process a request). Instead of maintaining active memory states, actors **hibernate**.
    - Hibernation involves storing the minimal **state information** in a lightweight format, often by serializing the actor state to **SQLite** or similar persistent storage. This state includes the Correlation ID, input data, and current processing step.

2. **Hibernation Triggers**:
    - Hibernation is triggered when a specific condition is met:
        - **External Waiting**: An actor needs to wait for a callback or external input, such as a user response or a third-party service.
        - **Time-Based Triggers**: When an actor needs to delay processing until a specific timestamp.

3. **Resuming Hibernated Tasks**:
    - Resuming a hibernated task involves the **Queue Manager** notifying the actor when the required condition is met (e.g., an incoming callback or the expiry of a timer).
    - The actor deserializes its state, retrieves the **Correlation ID**, and continues processing from the saved point, ensuring that no duplicate tasks are created or processed.
    - This mechanism is comparable to **Saga patterns** in distributed systems, allowing complex workflows to be maintained across system restarts or interruptions.

4. **Serialization and State Storage**:
    - State storage for hibernated actors uses **Kotlinx Serialization**, which allows the lightweight serialization of data structures into formats like JSON.
    - Serialization keeps storage efficient, and state restoration is seamless, ensuring that actors can return to exactly where they left off.
    - The serialized state is stored in a local database (**SQLite**) to ensure rapid retrieval. The database schema includes fields for actor type, Correlation ID, state, and timestamp.

### Queue Management Strategies
1. **Priority Queues**:
    - Different workflows might have different levels of priority. For instance, **health-check actors** might have a higher priority compared to **batch-processing actors**.
    - The **Queue Manager** is responsible for prioritizing tasks based on predefined configurations. This allows the system to allocate resources effectively without causing bottlenecks.

2. **Rate Limiting**:
    - To avoid overwhelming specific actors, the queue manager includes **rate limiting** capabilities. Rate limits ensure that only a certain number of tasks per actor are processed per time unit, preventing resource exhaustion and providing predictable throughput.

3. **Fallback and Retrying Mechanism**:
    - If an actor fails to process a task, the task is returned to the queue with an incremented retry count.
    - After a specific number of retries, tasks can be routed to a **fallback actor** which might apply a different logic (e.g., save to a manual intervention queue or log an alert for an administrator).

### System Communication and Orchestration
- **Supervisor Actor**: The supervisor is key to queue orchestration. It interacts with both the centralized queue manager and the local actor queues, determining which actor should be assigned which task, based on priority and current load.
- **Channel Communication**: Ktor **channels** are employed for internal communication, where supervisor actors coordinate worker actors and manage queue-related data, ensuring actors aren’t overwhelmed and tasks don’t get stuck in the queue.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Distributed Queue Management**: For scaling beyond a single instance, we could leverage distributed message brokers such as **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**, or potentially use **Kotlin's Multik** with clustering support.
2. **Actor Lifecycle Analytics**: Providing detailed metrics on hibernation counts, retry rates, and processing times will help in optimizing actor workflows. Integration with **Prometheus** will give insights into which actors are most effective and where improvements can be made.
3. **Callback Channels**: We could add specialized **callback channels** for specific actors waiting on external events to avoid overwhelming the general-purpose queue with unrelated task data.

### Summary
The queue and hibernation management system in Solace Core aims to balance efficiency and resilience, allowing actors to handle both long-running and short-lived tasks without overloading resources. By using centralized and localized queues, Correlation IDs, hibernation strategies, and fallback mechanisms, the system can maintain high throughput and reliability while executing complex workflows. This provides a robust foundation for managing distributed AI-driven processes that can adapt to various demands and challenges.
