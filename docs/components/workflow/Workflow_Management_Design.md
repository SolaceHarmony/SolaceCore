# Workflow Management Design

## Introduction
The workflow management system orchestrates the execution of actors within the Solace Core Framework. It enables the dynamic composition of actors into workflows, allowing for flexible and scalable processing pipelines.

## Core Purpose & Design Principles

The workflow module, centered around the `WorkflowManager` class, is designed to orchestrate the execution of actors within SolaceCore. It enables the dynamic composition of actors into workflows, facilitating the creation of flexible and scalable processing pipelines. This module ties together individual actor capabilities into cohesive, manageable, and higher-level operational units.

### Design Principles
- **Flexibility**: Support for dynamic composition of actors into workflows.
- **Type Safety**: Ensure type compatibility between connected actors.
- **State Management**: Maintain and manage workflow state throughout execution.
- **Error Handling**: Provide robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **Persistence**: Support for persisting workflow state for recovery and continuity.

## Current Implementation

### Workflow Manager
- **Actor Network Management**: Manages a network of actors, including adding actors, connecting them, and managing their lifecycle.
- **State Management**: Maintains the state of the workflow, allowing for start, stop, and error handling.
- **Orchestration**: Orchestrates the execution of actors within workflows.
- **Monitoring and Control**: Provides capabilities for monitoring and controlling workflow execution.

### Workflow States
- **Initialized**: The workflow has been created/defined (actors added, connections specified) but not started.
- **Running**: The workflow is actively executing / its actors are typically running and processing messages.
- **Paused**: The workflow has been temporarily suspended / its actors are temporarily paused.
- **Stopped**: The workflow and its actors have been stopped.
- **Error**: The workflow has encountered an error.

### Conceptual Execution Flow
1. A workflow is constructed (e.g., using the `WorkflowBuilder` concept or direct `WorkflowManager` calls).
2. The workflow is started using the `WorkflowManager`.
3. Actors within the workflow are executed according to their connections.
4. The workflow can be paused, resumed, or stopped as needed.
5. When the workflow completes or is stopped, resources are properly disposed.

## Dynamic Workflow Construction
- **Actor Composition**: Facilitates the dynamic composition of actors into workflows, enabling the creation of complex processing pipelines.
- **Connection Management**: Manages connections between actors, ensuring type compatibility and proper channel setup.
- **WorkflowBuilder Concept**: A fluent API for constructing workflows, with methods for adding actors and connecting them within workflows.

## Current Status
- **Completed Tasks**: Basic workflow management and actor composition are implemented.
- **Partially Completed Tasks**: Advanced state management and error handling are in progress.

## Future Enhancements
- **Workflow Pause and Resume**: Implement functionality to pause and resume workflows, allowing for greater control over execution.
- **State Persistence**: Develop mechanisms for persisting workflow state, enabling recovery and continuity.
- **Distributed Workflows**: Support for workflows that can span multiple nodes or processes.
- **Workflow Versioning**: Implement support for versioning of workflow definitions.
- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Develop a visual interface for designing and monitoring workflows.

## Conclusion
The workflow management system provides a flexible and scalable framework for orchestrating actor-based workflows. Future enhancements will focus on improving control and resilience, enabling advanced state management and persistence capabilities.
