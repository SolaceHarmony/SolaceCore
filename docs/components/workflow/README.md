# Workflow Management Architecture

## Overview
The workflow management system orchestrates the execution of actors within the Solace Core Framework. It enables the dynamic composition of actors into workflows, allowing for flexible and scalable processing pipelines.

> **Note**: This component is currently in the planning and early implementation phase. The documentation will be updated as the implementation progresses.

## Design Principles
- **Flexibility**: Support for dynamic composition of actors into workflows
- **Type Safety**: Ensure type compatibility between connected actors
- **State Management**: Maintain and manage workflow state throughout execution
- **Error Handling**: Provide robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Persistence**: Support for persisting workflow state for recovery and continuity

## Planned Architecture

### Core Components

#### Workflow Manager
The `WorkflowManager` will be responsible for:
- Managing the lifecycle of workflows
- Orchestrating the execution of actors within workflows
- Handling errors and state transitions
- Providing monitoring and control capabilities

#### Workflow Builder
The `WorkflowBuilder` will provide:
- A fluent API for constructing workflows
- Methods for adding actors to workflows
- Methods for connecting actors within workflows
- Validation of workflow structure and connections

### Workflow States
Workflows will have the following states:
- **Initialized**: The workflow has been created but not started
- **Running**: The workflow is actively executing
- **Paused**: The workflow has been temporarily suspended
- **Stopped**: The workflow has been stopped
- **Error**: The workflow has encountered an error

### Execution Flow
1. A workflow is constructed using the `WorkflowBuilder`
2. The workflow is started using the `WorkflowManager`
3. Actors within the workflow are executed according to their connections
4. The workflow can be paused, resumed, or stopped as needed
5. When the workflow completes or is stopped, resources are properly disposed

## Current Implementation Status
- ⚠️ Basic workflow management (partially implemented)
- ⚠️ Actor composition (partially implemented)
- ❌ Advanced state management (planned)
- ❌ Workflow pause and resume (planned)
- ❌ State persistence (planned)

## Future Enhancements
- **Workflow Pause and Resume**: Implement functionality to pause and resume workflows
- **State Persistence**: Develop mechanisms for persisting workflow state
- **Distributed Workflows**: Support for workflows that span multiple nodes
- **Workflow Versioning**: Support for versioning and migration of workflow definitions
- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Develop a visual interface for designing workflows
