# Lifecycle Management Architecture

## Overview
The lifecycle management component provides a standardized approach to managing the lifecycle of various components in the Solace Core Framework. It ensures proper initialization, operation, and cleanup of resources, which is crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing resource leaks.

## Design Principles
- **Resource Safety**: Ensure all resources are properly disposed of when no longer needed
- **Consistency**: Provide a consistent lifecycle model across all components
- **Simplicity**: Keep the lifecycle management simple and easy to implement
- **Platform Independence**: Work consistently across different platforms
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors during lifecycle operations

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Disposable
The `Disposable` interface is the foundation of resource management:

```kotlin
interface Disposable {
    suspend fun dispose()
    
    companion object {
        suspend fun dispose(vararg disposables: Disposable) {
            disposables.forEach { it.dispose() }
        }
    }
    
    suspend fun safeDispose() {
        try {
            dispose()
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("Error during disposal: ${e.message}")
        }
    }
}
```

The `Disposable` interface:
- Defines a contract for releasing resources
- Provides utility methods for safely disposing of resources
- Includes a companion object method for disposing of multiple resources at once

#### Lifecycle
The `Lifecycle` interface extends `Disposable` to provide a complete lifecycle management contract:

```kotlin
interface Lifecycle : Disposable {
    suspend fun start()
    suspend fun stop()
    fun isActive(): Boolean
}
```

The `Lifecycle` interface:
- Extends `Disposable` to inherit resource management capabilities
- Adds methods for starting and stopping components
- Provides a method to check if a component is active

### Lifecycle States
Components implementing the `Lifecycle` interface typically follow these states:

1. **Initialized**: The component has been created but not started
2. **Running**: The component is active and operational
3. **Stopped**: The component has been stopped but resources are still allocated
4. **Disposed**: All resources have been released

### Implementation Pattern
A typical implementation of the `Lifecycle` interface might look like:

```kotlin
class SomeComponent : Lifecycle {
    private var isRunning = false
    
    override suspend fun start() {
        // Initialize resources
        isRunning = true
    }
    
    override suspend fun stop() {
        // Stop operations
        isRunning = false
    }
    
    override fun isActive(): Boolean = isRunning
    
    override suspend fun dispose() {
        stop()
        // Release resources
    }
}
```

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Disposable interface for resource management
- ✅ Lifecycle interface for component lifecycle management
- ✅ Implementation in Actor and Port components
- ⚠️ Comprehensive error handling (partially implemented)
- ❌ Lifecycle event notifications (planned)

## Future Enhancements
- **Lifecycle Event Notifications**: Implement a system for notifying interested parties about lifecycle state changes
- **Dependency Management**: Add support for managing dependencies between components with different lifecycles
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Develop mechanisms for automatically tracking and disposing of resources
- **Improved Error Recovery**: Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms during lifecycle operations
- **Lifecycle Monitoring**: Add tools for monitoring the lifecycle state of components
