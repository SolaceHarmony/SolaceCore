# Kernel Architecture

## Overview
The kernel is a foundational component of the Solace Core Framework, providing the underlying infrastructure for communication and resource management. It includes the channels and ports system, which enables type-safe message passing between actors and other components.

## Design Principles
- **Type Safety**: All communication is strongly typed to ensure compatibility
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of resources through the Disposable interface
- **Flexibility**: Support for different types of communication patterns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to extend with new port types and protocol adapters
- **Concurrency**: Built for concurrent operations using Kotlin coroutines

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Ports
The port system is the primary mechanism for communication:

- **Port Interface**: Defines the contract for sending and receiving messages
  ```kotlin
  interface Port<T : Any> : Disposable {
      val id: String
      val name: String
      val type: KClass<out T>
      fun asChannel(): Channel<T>
      suspend fun send(message: T)
  }
  ```

- **BidirectionalPort**: Implements bidirectional communication
  ```kotlin
  class BidirectionalPort<T : Any>(
      override val name: String,
      override val id: String = Port.generateId(),
      override val type: KClass<out T>,
      private val bufferSize: Int = Channel.BUFFERED
  ) : Port<T>
  ```

#### Port Connections
Connections establish communication paths between ports:

- **PortConnection**: Represents a connection between two ports
  ```kotlin
  data class PortConnection<in IN : Any, out OUT : Any>(
      val sourcePort: Port<IN>,
      val targetPort: Port<OUT>,
      val handlers: List<MessageHandler<IN, Any>>,
      val protocolAdapter: ProtocolAdapter<*, OUT>?,
      val rules: List<ConversionRule<IN, OUT>>
  )
  ```

#### Message Handling
The kernel provides mechanisms for processing messages:

- **MessageHandler**: Processes messages and produces results
  ```kotlin
  interface MessageHandler<in IN : Any, out OUT : Any> {
      suspend fun handle(message: IN): OUT
  }
  ```

- **ProtocolAdapter**: Converts between different message types
  ```kotlin
  interface ProtocolAdapter<SOURCE : Any, TARGET : Any> {
      suspend fun encode(source: SOURCE): TARGET
      suspend fun decode(target: TARGET): SOURCE
      fun canHandle(sourceType: KClass<*>, targetType: KClass<*>): Boolean
  }
  ```

- **ConversionRule**: Transforms messages from one type to another
  ```kotlin
  abstract class ConversionRule<in IN : Any, out OUT : Any> {
      abstract suspend fun convert(input: IN): OUT
      abstract fun canHandle(inputType: KClass<*>, outputType: KClass<*>): Boolean
      abstract fun describe(): String
  }
  ```

### Communication Flow
1. A port is created with a specific message type
2. The port is connected to another compatible port
3. Messages are sent through the source port
4. Messages are processed by handlers and conversion rules
5. Processed messages are received by the target port

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Port interface and BidirectionalPort implementation
- ✅ Port connections with validation
- ✅ Message handlers and conversion rules
- ✅ Protocol adapters for type conversion
- ⚠️ Dynamic port creation and disconnection (partially implemented)
- ❌ Advanced type checking mechanisms (planned)

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Port Management**: Implement support for dynamic port creation and disconnection
- **Advanced Type Checking**: Develop more sophisticated type checking mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve message passing performance
- **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive monitoring for message flow
- **Backpressure Handling**: Implement mechanisms for handling backpressure in message queues
