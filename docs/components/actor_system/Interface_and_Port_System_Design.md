# Interface and Port System Design

## Introduction
The interface and port system in the Solace Core Framework provides a flexible mechanism for defining and connecting actor inputs and outputs. It ensures type safety and dynamic compatibility between actors.

## Current Implementation

### Actor Interface
- **Port System**: Defines inputs, outputs, and tools as ports, allowing for flexible connections between actors.
- **Dynamic Connections**: Supports dynamic connection of output ports to input ports, ensuring type compatibility.

### Port Class
- **Port Types**: Defines `Input`, `Output`, and `Tool` ports, each with specific functionalities for receiving, sending, and processing data.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures type safety through the use of Kotlin's `KClass`.

## Current Status
- **Completed Tasks**: Flexible input/output interfaces and type-safe port system are implemented.
- **Partially Completed Tasks**: Dynamic port creation and disconnection logic are in progress.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Port Management**: Implement support for dynamic port creation and disconnection, allowing for greater flexibility in actor connections.
- **Advanced Type Checking**: Develop advanced type checking mechanisms to ensure compatibility and prevent errors.

## Conclusion
The interface and port system provides a robust framework for defining and managing actor connections. Future enhancements will focus on improving flexibility and type safety, enabling dynamic port management and advanced type checking capabilities.
