# Actor System Design

## Introduction
The actor system is the core component of the Solace Core Framework, responsible for managing the execution and interaction of modular actors. Each actor encapsulates specific functionality and communicates with other actors through message passing.

## Current Implementation

### Actor Class
- **Core Functionality**: Provides the basic structure for actors, including message processing, error handling, and lifecycle management (start, stop).
- **Interface Definition**: Each actor defines its interface through the `defineInterface` method, specifying inputs, outputs, and tools.
- **Message Handling**: Actors process messages in a loop, with error handling mechanisms in place.

### Supervisor Actor
- **Actor Management**: Manages the lifecycle of other actors, including registration, unregistration, and hot-swapping.
- **Concurrency Control**: Uses a mutex to ensure thread-safe operations on the actor registry.
- **Dynamic Registration**: Supports registering and unregistering actors at runtime.
- **Hot-Swapping**: Allows replacing actors with new instances of the same type while preserving their connections.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that actors are only replaced with compatible types.

## Concurrency and Communication
- **Coroutines**: Utilized for asynchronous message processing, allowing actors to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking.
- **Channels**: Facilitate communication between actors, ensuring data flows smoothly through the system.
- **Thread Safety**: All operations on shared resources are protected by mutexes to prevent race conditions.

## Current Status
- **Completed Tasks**: Basic actor structure, message handling, supervisor management, dynamic actor registration, and hot-swapping are implemented.
- **Partially Completed Tasks**: Advanced queuing mechanisms and correlation IDs are in progress.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Queuing Mechanisms**: Develop sophisticated queuing mechanisms for managing message flow and preventing overload.
- **Correlation IDs**: Introduce correlation IDs for tracking and managing tasks across actors.
- **Distributed Actor System**: Extend the actor system to work across multiple nodes in a distributed environment.
- **Hierarchical Supervision**: Implement nested supervisor hierarchies for better error handling and recovery.
- **Actor State Transfer**: Support transferring state between actors during hot-swapping.
- **Dynamic Port Reconnection**: Automatically reconnect ports after hot-swapping actors.

## Conclusion
The actor system provides a robust foundation for building scalable, concurrent workflows. With the implementation of the SupervisorActor, the system now supports dynamic actor registration and hot-swapping, enabling runtime modification of the actor system without requiring restarts. Future enhancements will focus on improving distributed capabilities, hierarchical supervision, state transfer during hot-swapping, and advanced queuing mechanisms.
