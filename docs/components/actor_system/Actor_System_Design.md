# Actor System Design

## Introduction
The actor system is the core component of the Solace Core Framework, responsible for managing the execution and interaction of modular actors. Each actor encapsulates specific functionality and communicates with other actors through message passing.

## Current Implementation

### Actor Class
- **Core Functionality**: Provides the basic structure for actors, including message processing, error handling, and lifecycle management (start, stop).
- **Interface Definition**: Each actor defines its interface through the `defineInterface` method, specifying inputs, outputs, and tools.
- **Message Handling**: Actors process messages in a loop, with error handling mechanisms in place.

### Supervisor Actor
- **Actor Management**: Manages the lifecycle of other actors, including registration and unregistration.
- **Concurrency Control**: Uses a mutex to ensure thread-safe operations on the actor registry.

## Concurrency and Communication
- **Coroutines**: Utilized for asynchronous message processing, allowing actors to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking.
- **Channels**: Facilitate communication between actors, ensuring data flows smoothly through the system.

## Current Status
- **Completed Tasks**: Basic actor structure, message handling, and supervisor management are implemented.
- **Partially Completed Tasks**: Dynamic actor registration and hot-swapping are in progress.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Actor Management**: Implement dynamic addition, removal, and modification of actors without system restarts.
- **Queuing Mechanisms**: Develop queuing mechanisms for managing message flow and preventing overload.
- **Correlation IDs**: Introduce correlation IDs for tracking and managing tasks across actors.

## Conclusion
The actor system provides a robust foundation for building scalable, concurrent workflows. Future enhancements will focus on improving flexibility and resilience, enabling dynamic actor management and advanced queuing capabilities.
