# Storage Solutions Design

## Introduction
The storage solutions in the Solace Core Framework aim to provide robust and scalable data management using a combination of graph and local databases. The integration of Neo4j and Kotlin-native storage will support complex data relationships and structured data needs.

## Planned Implementation

### Neo4j Integration
- **Graph Storage**: Utilize Neo4j to represent relationships between actors, knowledge nodes, and data flow.
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Support advanced scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent data retrieval.

### Kotlin-Native Storage
- **Structured Data**: Implement a Kotlin-native storage solution for tabular or relational-style data.
- **Persistence**: Ensure actors can store intermediate results and states persistently.

## Current Status
- **Planned Tasks**: Neo4j integration and Kotlin-native storage are planned but not yet implemented.

## Future Enhancements
- **Data Synchronization**: Develop mechanisms for synchronizing data between graph and local databases.
- **Advanced Querying**: Implement advanced querying capabilities to support complex data retrieval and manipulation.

## Conclusion
The storage solutions will provide a comprehensive framework for managing data within the Solace Core Framework. Future enhancements will focus on integrating Neo4j and Kotlin-native storage, enabling advanced data management and retrieval capabilities.
