# Workflow Management Design

## Introduction
The workflow management system orchestrates the execution of actors within the Solace Core Framework. It enables the dynamic composition of actors into workflows, allowing for flexible and scalable processing pipelines.

## Current Implementation

### Workflow Manager
- **Actor Network Management**: Manages a network of actors, including adding actors, connecting them, and managing their lifecycle.
- **State Management**: Maintains the state of the workflow, allowing for start, stop, and error handling.

## Dynamic Workflow Construction
- **Actor Composition**: Facilitates the dynamic composition of actors into workflows, enabling the creation of complex processing pipelines.
- **Connection Management**: Manages connections between actors, ensuring type compatibility and proper channel setup.

## Current Status
- **Completed Tasks**: Basic workflow management and actor composition are implemented.
- **Partially Completed Tasks**: Advanced state management and error handling are in progress.

## Future Enhancements
- **Workflow Pause and Resume**: Implement functionality to pause and resume workflows, allowing for greater control over execution.
- **State Persistence**: Develop mechanisms for persisting workflow state, enabling recovery and continuity.

## Conclusion
The workflow management system provides a flexible and scalable framework for orchestrating actor-based workflows. Future enhancements will focus on improving control and resilience, enabling advanced state management and persistence capabilities.
